# Convolutional Neural Networks for the automated recognition of cats and dogs images
This repository contain a project of Machine Learning for the binary classification of cats and dogs images.

## About The Project
------------------------------------
This is a project developed for Statistical Methods for Machine Learning exam at the University of Milan (academic year 2021-2022). In this project, I address the issue of binary classification, considering a dataset composed by dogs and cats images. In this scenario, the proposed approach is to employ Convolutional Neural Network frameworks, which are more suitable in case of image classification.
