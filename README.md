### About The Project
This project was developed for the Statistical Methods for Machine Learning exam at the University of Milan (academic year 2021-2022). In this project, the issue of binary classification is addeessed considering a dataset composed by dogs and cats images. In this scenario, the proposed approach consists in training some Convolutional Neural Networks, which are more suitable in case of image classification.

### Built With
* Python 3.10.11
* Tensorflow version: 2.9.2
* OpenCV

### Composition of the repository
- Peoject CatsDogs CNN.jpynb: file containing data preprocessing and CNNs execution.
- Report containing more theoretical details about the implemented CNNs and the relative training results.

### Shared Google drive folder
This link below connects to the shared CatsDogs folder containing three subfolders (Cats, Dogs and Pickles). As written in the GoogleColab file, if you want to skip all the data preprocessing phases, I suggest you to directly use or download the files contained in Pickles (images_grey.pickle, labels_grey.pickle) and run the code from the section named 'Normalizing pixel values' present in the GoogleColab file. By doing so, you will be ready for running the CNNs models! More details are in GoogleColab file. Since Colab is connected to Google Drive, I suggest to use this folder to speed up the process.
