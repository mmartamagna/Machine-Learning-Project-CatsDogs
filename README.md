## Convolutional Neural Networks for the automated recognition of cats and dogs images

### About The Project
This is a project developed for Statistical Methods for Machine Learning exam at the University of Milan (academic year 2021-2022). In this project, I address the issue of binary classification, considering a dataset composed by dogs and cats images. In this scenario, the proposed approach is to employ Convolutional Neural Network frameworks, which are more suitable in case of image classification.

### Built With
* Python
* Tensorflow version: 2.9.2
* OpenCV

### Composition of the repository
- Data preprocessing: .json file about data preprocessing
- CatsDogs CNN Models.jpynb: file containing both data preprocessing and CNNs execution

### Shared Google drive folder
This folder contains three subfolders, namely Cats, Dogs and Pickles. As written in the GoogleColab file, if you want to skip all the data preprocessing phases, I suggest you to directly use the files contained in Pickles. More details are in GoogleColab file or Datapreprocessing file. Since Colab is connected to Google Drive, I suggest to use this folder to speed up the process.
