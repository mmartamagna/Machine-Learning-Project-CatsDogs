### About The Project
This is a project developed for Statistical Methods for Machine Learning exam at the University of Milan (academic year 2021-2022). In this project, I address the issue of binary classification, considering a dataset composed by dogs and cats images. In this scenario, the proposed approach is to employ Convolutional Neural Network frameworks, which are more suitable in case of image classification.

### Built With
* Python
* Tensorflow version: 2.9.2
* OpenCV

### Composition of the repository
- Data preprocessing: .json file about data preprocessing
- CatsDogs CNN Models.jpynb: file containing both data preprocessing and CNNs execution

### Shared Google drive folder
This link below connects to shared CatsDogs folder containing three subfolders (Cats, Dogs and Pickles). As written in the GoogleColab file, if you want to skip all the data preprocessing phases, I suggest you to directly use or download the files contained in Pickles (images_grey.pickle, labels_grey.pickle) and run the code from the section named 'Normalizing pixel values' present in the GoogleColab file. By doing so, you will be ready for running the CNNs models! More details are in GoogleColab file. Since Colab is connected to Google Drive, I suggest to use this folder to speed up the process.
